## Introduction

Spring Security is an essential part of many Java-based applications, providing robust authentication and authorization functionalities. This project aims to explore various aspects of Spring Security, including configuration, authentication mechanisms, authorization, and best practices. 🚀

## Features

- 🔑 **Authentication:** Secure login mechanisms including form-based, OAuth, LDAP, and more.
- 📜 **Authorization:** Fine-grained access control based on roles, permissions, or custom logic.
- 🔐 **Password Management:** Hashing, salting, and secure storage of passwords.
- ⏲️ **Session Management:** Controlling user sessions and handling session-related security concerns.
- 🚫 **CSRF Protection:** Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention mechanisms.
- 📡 **Security Headers:** Implementing HTTP security headers for enhanced protection.

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK)
   - Apache Maven or Gradle
   - Your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

3. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
      java -jar target/your-app.jar
    ```
## Usage
Configuration:

🔒 Configure security settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
Define authentication and authorization rules in Spring Security configuration files.

Implement Custom Security Features:

🛠️ Extend Spring Security classes for custom authentication providers, user details services, etc.
Implement custom filters, handlers, and listeners for advanced security requirements.

Testing:

🧪 Write unit tests for security configurations and components.
Perform integration tests to ensure security mechanisms work as expected.
